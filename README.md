# PCI Compliance Mini Lab

This repository contains a small, self-directed lab created to better understand the day-to-day responsibilities of a PCI Compliance Analyst.

## Scenario
A fictional business unit ("ResortPay") processes cardholder payments for resort bookings. The goal of this lab was to identify PCI scope, define the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), document data flows, and organize compliance evidence aligned to PCI DSS requirements.

## What This Lab Covers
- PCI scope and CDE definition
- High-level data flow and segmentation diagram
- Evidence indexing aligned to PCI DSS control requirements
- Sample artifacts representing encryption, logging, and network segmentation controls

## Why This Lab Was Created
This lab was built to translate PCI DSS requirements into practical workflows such as scoping, evidence collection, and audit preparation—similar to what a PCI analyst supports in a real enterprise environment.

## Next Steps in a Real Environment
- Validate scope and segmentation with system owners
- Perform segmentation testing
- Review log retention and monitoring coverage
- Track remediation activities in an eGRC or ticketing system
